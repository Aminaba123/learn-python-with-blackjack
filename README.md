Blackjack Game for learning Python
==================================

I made this code to teach some basics to a friend, maybe you find it useful too!

Three files are included:
* Functional implementation of Blackjack (blackjack.py),
* Object-oriented version of the game (blackjack_oo.py),
* A very very basic test, to check some cases for the calculate_score function (test_blackjack.py).

I encourage you to take my imperfect implementation and improve it. Improve it as much as you can, add libraries, 
colours to terminal lines to make it beautiful, more players, features, and whatever you want to learn more python!

I recommend to use PyCharm to edit the code:

In order to understand how the program runs in a easier way, use the debugger to stop the code and examine each line.
The debugger is a very useful tool for beginners to understand how programming works, but also a mandatory tool for 
the professional programmer in daily basis:

In case you want to run each one of the scripts, assuming you have python installed, write in your console the following lines:
`$ python blackjack.py
`$ python blackjack_oo.py`
